### Use Cases
* A manager taking feedback from their team members
* A online teacher requesting feedback from students
* Post presentation feedbacks in conferences
* More real world scenarios you can think of...

### Why is it needed? 
* Given that there are number of anonymous feedback tools already available, what make Namelss unique is its ability to interact real time while being anonymous.
* Google forms · 15Five · ‎Officevibe · ‎TinyPulse · ‎Qualtrics etc do not allow you to interact realtime. 

### Built With
Tech stack used : 
* [Frontend - React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Backend - Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
* [Database - Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
